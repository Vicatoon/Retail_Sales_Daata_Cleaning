# Retail_Sales_Daata_Cleaning
This project is a hands-on example of cleaning messy real-world retail sales data using Python and pandas. The dataset needed quite a bit of love â€” missing values, inconsistent formatting, and unnecessary columns. The goal was to get it cleaned up and ready for analysis or reporting.

##  What I Did

- Renamed and reordered columns for clarity
- Fixed missing values:
- Replaced missing Boolean fields with "Unknown"
- Cleaned up nulls across key columns
- Converted timestamps into a readable datetime format
- Standardised categorical entries
- Removed columns that werenâ€™t useful for analysis
- Exported the cleaned data to CSV

##  Why I Did This

I wanted to get more hands-on with real data problems, not just analysis-ready datasets. This project helped me sharpen my data wrangling skills, especially around:
- Understanding data context before cleaning
- Making decisions on how to handle missing or inconsistent values
- Writing clear, repeatable code in Jupyter Notebook
